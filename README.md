# Rock-Papper-Scissor
In this program you have to choose 1, 2 or 3!
Which is 1 for rock, 2 for paper, 3 for scissor!
Then it randomly chooses among the three!
Then it is compared whether you lose, win or tie!
Then it prints the result!

There is plenty of area for flaws in this program, feel free to modify the program!
